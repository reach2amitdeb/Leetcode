509. Fibonacci Number
---------------------
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
//Here complexity is O(2^n): Not a good solution
//        if(n <= 1){
//            return n;
//        }else{
//            return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
//        }
//Here complexity is O(n): Better than previous solution
         int a = 0; 
         int b = 1;
         int c = 0;
         int count = 0;
         while(count < n){
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            count++;
         }
         return a;

    }
}
